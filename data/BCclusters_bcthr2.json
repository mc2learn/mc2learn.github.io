The majority of literature in this cluster comes from the United States, then the United Kingdom, and Canada.","available":{"Y":100.00,"K":86.55,"S":100.00,"J":100.00,"R":100.00,"A":100.00,"C":100.00},"stuff":{"Y":[["2019",15.97,1.86],["2020",15.97,1.81],["2021",15.97,1.97],["2016",11.76,1.19],["2018",8.40,-0.13],["2015",6.72,-0.52],["2012",4.20,0.48],["2017",4.20,-1.47],["2009",3.36,0.21],["2013",3.36,-0.39],["2004",2.52,1.61],["2011",2.52,-0.65],["2014",2.52,-2.09],["2000",0.84,1.06],["2007",0.84,-0.52],["2010",0.84,-1.40]],"K":[["SCIENCE",36.13,9.45],["PERFORMANCE",16.81,3.09],["EDUCATION",15.97,0.37],["STUDENTS",13.45,-0.73],["TECHNOLOGY",8.40,0.31],["ACHIEVEMENT",7.56,0.50],["CLASSROOM",7.56,0.32],["PERCEPTIONS",7.56,2.10],["INSTRUCTION",6.72,1.00],["ENGAGEMENT",5.88,1.04],["IMPLEMENTATION",5.88,3.19],["KNOWLEDGE",5.04,-1.74],["MATHEMATICS",5.04,1.35],["PEER",5.04,2.75],["EXPERIENCES",4.20,1.85],["IMPACT",4.20,-0.85],["BENEFITS",3.36,3.87],["CHEMISTRY",3.36,2.63],["DISCOURSE",3.36,-0.20],["LECTURE",3.36,4.72]],"S":[["Education & Educational Research",78.15,-1.90],["Education, Scientific Disciplines",70.59,6.17],["Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",7.56,-4.36],["Engineering, Multidisciplinary",5.04,-1.11],["Biology",4.20,2.11],["Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",4.20,4.73],["Health Care Sciences & Services",1.68,-0.34],["Psychology, Educational",1.68,-3.14],["Psychology, Multidisciplinary",1.68,2.38],["Business",0.84,3.45],["Education, Special",0.84,-0.94],["Information Science & Library Science",0.84,-1.10],["Management",0.84,2.25],["Physics, Multidisciplinary",0.84,1.68],["Physiology",0.84,0.33],["Psychology, Applied",0.84,1.68]],"J":[["CHEM EDUC RES PRACT",10.08,6.15],["INT J STEM EDUC",9.24,6.89],["BMC MED EDUC",6.72,-2.03],["PHYS REV PHYS EDUC R",6.72,5.91],["COMPUT EDUC",5.88,-3.50],["CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC",4.20,3.98],["J BIOL EDUC",4.20,2.20],["J CHEM EDUC",4.20,4.73],["PHYS REV SPEC TOP-PH",4.20,5.41],["ANAT SCI EDUC",2.52,2.30],["J ENG EDUC",2.52,0.57],["J SCI EDUC TECHNOL",2.52,-0.18],["ACM T COMPUT EDUC",1.68,3.19],["ADV HEALTH SCI EDUC",1.68,0.33],["EUR J ENG EDUC",1.68,4.88],["IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL",1.68,-1.03],["INT J EDUC SCI",1.68,3.19],["INT J TECHNOL DES ED",1.68,-1.17],["J EXP EDUC",1.68,3.19],["TEACH PSYCHOL",1.68,2.38]],"R":[["Freeman S, 2014, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, 111, 8410",26.89,18.72],["Springer L, 1999, REV EDUC RES, 69, 21",26.05,13.47],["Prince M, 2004, J ENG EDUC, 93, 223",20.17,13.64],["Crouch CH, 2001, AM J PHYS, 69, 970",11.76,10.83],["Hake RR, 1998, AM J PHYS, 66, 64",11.76,10.83],["Mazur E, 1997, PEER INSTRUCTION USE",10.08,10.96],["Smith MK, 2009, SCIENCE, 323, 122",9.24,8.55],["Braun V, 2006, QUAL RES PSYCHOL, 3, 77",7.56,2.07],["Heller P, 1992, AM J PHYS, 60, 627",7.56,9.23],["Johnson David W, 1998, CHANGE MAGAZINE HIGH, 30, 26",7.56,7.04],["Eberlein T, 2008, BIOCHEM MOL BIOL EDU, 36, 262",6.72,9.13],["Hestenes D, 1992, PHYS TEACH, 30, 141",6.72,8.10],["Becker N, 2013, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, 14, 81",5.88,9.14],["Heller P, 1992, AM J PHYS, 60, 637",5.88,6.98],["Bell T, 2010, INT J SCI EDUC, 32, 349",5.04,4.14],["Cohen J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, 2, 0",5.04,1.85],["Cross KP, 2014, COLLABORATIVE LEARNI",5.04,5.24],["Henderson C, 2007, PHYS REV SPEC TOP-PH, 3, 0",5.04,8.46],["Henderson C, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, 48, 952",5.04,8.46],["Johnson DW, 2009, EDUC RESEARCHER, 38, 37",5.04,1.60]],"A":[["Hamalainen R",2.52,3.51],["Lamsa J",2.52,5.05],["Viiri J",2.52,5.05],["Eichler JF",1.68,4.88],["Foote KT",1.68,4.88],["Frey RF",1.68,4.88],["Goldberg F",1.68,4.88],["Henderson C",1.68,4.88],["Holmes NG",1.68,4.88],["Jordan ME",1.68,3.19],["Kalman CS",1.68,4.88],["Kelley MM",1.68,4.88],["Koskinen P",1.68,3.83],["Mcgill KL",1.68,4.88],["Price E",1.68,4.88],["Quinn KN",1.68,4.88],["Repice MD",1.68,4.88],["Rohar S",1.68,4.88],["Smith EM",1.68,4.88],["Whipps Z",1.68,4.88]],"C":[["USA",60.50,6.60],["UK",5.88,-1.25],["Canada",5.04,-0.01],["Finland",5.04,0.35],["Australia",4.20,-1.42],["Netherlands",4.20,-1.28],["New Zealand",2.52,1.12],["South Africa",2.52,1.39],["Sweden",2.52,0.63],["Chile",1.68,0.26],["Germany",1.68,-1.84],["Peoples R China",1.68,-2.21],["South Korea",1.68,-0.34],["Spain",1.68,-1.94],["Taiwan",1.68,-1.68],["U Arab Emirates",1.68,3.18],["India",0.84,0.43],["Indonesia",0.84,0.23],["Iraq",0.84,1.68],["Ireland",0.84,-0.38]],"MCP":[["Does active learning work?
